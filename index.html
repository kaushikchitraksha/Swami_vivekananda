                <p>In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, 
                    where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.[30] In 1879, after his family's return to
                   Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.
                    [31] He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, 
                    art and literature.[32] He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, 
                    the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music,
                    [33] and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western 
                    logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish 
                    Church College).[34] In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.
                    [35][36] Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, 
                    Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin.[37][38] He became 
                    fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him,[39][40] translating Herbert
                     Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali.[41] While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit 
                     scriptures and Bengali literature.[38] William Hastie (principal of Christian College, Calcutta; </p>
